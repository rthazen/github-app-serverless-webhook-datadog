# Serverless Github Bot

This repository is created for the [dash](https://www.dashcon.io) workshop "Building and Monitoring a Serverless App on AWS" and consists of logic for a github bot which responds to new issues.

The easiest way to interact with this is with the [full course](https://learn.datadoghq.com/courses/dash-workshop-building-and-monitoring-a-serverless-app-on-aws).

The final version of this repository for the course is on the branch `final-version`
